     * If you're new here, I bet you wanna know what's going on. Well pull up a
     * chair, grab a tasty snack and let's talk about it.
     *
     * So we like to keep our docs in the `react-router` repo as markdown files.
     * This makes it super easy for users who are browsing around the code to
     * see the docs right there in the source. That's pretty handy!
     *
     * If you're browsing around the docs in GitHub, you might see a link from
     * one doc to another. In markdown that would look something like this:
     *
     * > Check out our [API docs](../api.md)
     *
     * GitHub is going to resolve that link based on the file structure of the
     * repo, and so long as that file exists relative to the file in which the
     * Markdown is rendered, everything works. Splendid.
     *
     * When we build our database from the RR repo, we process the markdown
     * content and turn it into HTML using a bunch of fancy tools tucked away in
     * Ryan's `@ryanflorence/md` project. That tool is external and doesn't
     * really know how we're using it -- it simply converts the markdown into
     * HTML and spits it back to us. But we need to make some changes, because
     * the way the links are resolved on GitHub doesn't necessarily work on our
     * site once they are converted to HTML.
     *
     * First of all, none of the internal links on the site will have a `.md`
     * extension. Second, `index.md` files will appear without the `index` path
     * segment, meaning relative links to (and from) index files will look a bit
     * different.
     *
     * To make these tweaks, Ryan's `md` tool provides a `resolveHref` hook that
     * gives us direct access to the `href` value of all relative links it
     * encounters while parsing. We can manipulate it based on our site's route
     * structure. This means that markdown links always work in GitHub when
     * browsing the markdown files directly as well as our docs site.
